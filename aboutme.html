      <pre> <p> <strong> About Me </strong> <br>
        I define myself as a professional who loves solving a problem. 
        A learner who believes there is no age for learning new skills and whose purpose is growth, not just for himself but also for the company. 
      
        I am passionate about translating project visions and objectives into reality, offering tangible results aligned with client expectations. 
        In my prior work experience, I have utilized my organizational skills to effectively plan projects to meet deadlines while still paying attention to details. 
        I have successfully managed many projects at once. I value the trust and faith that the company has in having me. Hence, I believe in wearing multiple hats if needed. 
        
        I consider my work as an expression of who I am in reality, which is why 
        I even use Jira and Scrum to plan and execute important projects in my life. 
        I believe in continuous improvement in my soft skills, such as communication skills, conflict management, strategic planning & analysis, team management, budgeting,
        time management, and team leadership. 
         
        I am adept with multiple project management tools, including Jira, Asana, Monday.com, and Kanban. My expertise extends to Scrum, 
        Agile Methodologies, MS Excel, Google Analytics,
        Google Docs, and Google Sheets. 
        
        Hands-on experience using Python, HTML, SQL, MySQL, Django, WordPress, SharePoint, Slack, MS Project, and CSS to manage 3+ complex projects successfully. 
        
        Familiarity with additional PM programs and methodologies, including Hive, Celoxis, and Insightly, RDBMS like Oracle, Microsoft SQL, and GitHub
        
        Professional Certifications and Key Achievements: 
        1. Professional Scrum Master 1 (PSM 1), Scrum.org, March 11, 2022
        2. Executed implementation of $10000 of the WelexIndia website, achieving critical milestones on time and under budget, resulting in a 14% increase in annual revenue.
        3. The existing aligned website of Billion Trades with expansion initiatives increased site traffic by 36% and generated $30000 in new revenue in just six months.
        
        I am eager to hear about potential career opportunities, so I would be pleased to chat about job openings in the management sphere.</p>
